## 1. What is _GraphQL_ and how does it differ from _REST_?

**GraphQL** is a highly efficient data query and manipulation language paired with a server runtime. It's designed to **optimize data fetching for clients** by allowing them to specify the shape and structure of the data they need.

In contrast, **REST** is an architectural style where clients interact with server endpoints (resources) using a standard set of HTTP methods.

### Key Benefits of GraphQL over REST

- **Efficiency**: GraphQL minimizes data over-fetching and under-fetching, ensuring that clients receive only the necessary data. In contrast, REST endpoints have fixed responses, potentially leading to data redundancy or under-supply.

- **Flexibility**: With GraphQL, clients can specify the exact shape of the data they need. This is beneficial for applications with varying data requirements. REST endpoints deliver a pre-defined data set in their responses.

- **Versioning & Documentation**: GraphQL obviates the need for versioning and keeps documentation centralized. In REST, version management and documentation are typically separate from the API, complicating the process.

- **Data Validation**: GraphQL servers validate and type-check incoming requests. In REST, this is typically the client's responsibility.

- **Network Efficiency**: GraphQL often makes fewer network calls when acquiring related resources, compared to REST, which could necessitate multiple requests for the same resources.

- **Tooling & Ecosystem**: Both approaches enjoy extensive tooling support, but GraphQL's real-time introspection, strong type system, and auto-generation of documentation sets it apart. Additionally, GraphQL clients can benefit from query caching strategies.

- **Cache Control**: REST APIs provide various caching strategies using standard HTTP mechanisms. **Apollo Federation** in GraphQL further refines these strategies, offering finer control over caching across federated services.

- **Performance Optimizations**: Both REST and GraphQL can employ mechanisms like request throttling, but GraphQL's ability to batch multiple data requests into a single query contributes to improved performance.

- **Response Compression**: For reducing data size, GraphQL can utilize techniques like query result compression, while REST APIs can use response compression.

- **Data Consistency**: In a reliable setup, both REST and GraphQL can provide data consistency. However, when using GraphQL with subscriptions, real-time updates can be more straightforward to implement.

### When to Use GraphQL or REST

- **GraphQL**: Ideal for applications with diverse or changing data requirements, dynamic UIs demanding real-time data, or microservice architectures. Also suitable when the client and server are developed and maintained by the same team, ensuring end-to-end compatibility.

- **REST**: Recommended when the application has straightforward data requirements, relies on well-established data models, or the client's front-end architecture implements one-to-one mapping with the server's resources.

### Code Example: Basic Schema and Resolver

Here is the GraphQL code:

```graphql
type Query {
  # Retrieves a list of all users
  allUsers: [User]
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

# Example Query: Fetch all user names and emails
query {
  allUsers {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

Now, the equivalent REST endpoint for reference:

```plaintext
GET /api/users

Response Body:
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@gmail.com"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "email": "jane.smith@gmail.com"
  }
]
```
<br>

## 2. Explain the main components of the _GraphQL architecture_.

The **GraphQL architecture** revolves around several key components, each serving a distinct role in the broader ecosystem.

### Core Components

1. **Client**: The client initiates data requests, specifying their shape and content through GraphQL queries. This permits more streamlined data access compared to traditional REST operations.

2. **Server**: It's the server's task to process incoming GraphQL queries and deliver the relevant data in response. This paradigm of executing GraphQL queries is defined as "query execution."

3. **Schema**: The schema serves as the contract between the client and the server, establishing the **type system**, namely the types of data available for interaction (e.g., `User`, `Post`) and the **operations** that can be performed (e.g., `Query`, `Mutation`).

4. **Resolver Functions**: These functions are associated with each **field** in a GraphQL type and dictate how that field's data should be retrieved or manipulated. For instance, a resolver for a `user` field within a `Query` type might describe how to fetch a user.

5. **Query Validator and Executor**: After a query is received, the server performs a two-stage process: **validation** (ensuring the query adheres to the schema) and **execution** (fetching data as per the validated query and its resolvers).

### Supporting Components

  - **Data Source**: Represents the origin of real data, like a database. Each resolver can pull data from different data sources, which can improve modularity and scalability.

  - **Operations**: On the server, these can be of two types: `Query` for reading data and `Mutation` for modifying data. Additionally, one can write `Subscription` operations for real-time data updates.

### Flow of Operations

  - **Query**: Sent by the client to specify the data requirements. It's validated, and only if successful, the server operates on it.
  
  - **Validation**: The query is verified against the schema to confirm its correctness. If any elements in the query violate the schema, an error is sent back to the client.
  
  - **Execution**: The server employs the resolved functions to retrieve or process the required data, responding with the results in the expected format.
<br>

## 3. Can you describe the structure of a _GraphQL query_?

A **GraphQL query** specifies the data you seek and the shape you expect it back in. It's composed of **fields** nested within each other, forming a **query tree**.

### Language Elements

- **Fields**: The basic unit of a query, representing a piece of data you want to retrieve.
  
- **Arguments**: Used to customize the result of a field with specific parameters.

- **Aliases**: Enables multiple references to the same field with different configurations.

- **Fragments**: Reusable group of fields, improving the organization of query documents.

- **Directives**: Provide conditional query execution and value manipulation.

- **Operation Types**: Defines whether the query is for fetching data (`query`) or mutating data (`mutation`).

### Query Example: Fetching a User's Name and Last 5 Posts On Most Recently Used Device

GraphiQL Example:

```graphql
query {
  currentUser {
    name
    posts(last: 5)
  }
}
```

JSON Response that May be Returned:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "posts": [
      // Array of post objects
    ]
  }
}
```

### Query Syntax - Code Example: Firebase API

Here is the **Node.js** code:

  ```javascript
  var query = /* GraphQL */ `{
    currentUser {
      name
      posts(last: 5)
    }
  }`;

  firebaseUserModel.query(query).then(response => {
    console.log("User Data:", response);
  });
  ```
<br>

## 4. What are the core features of _GraphQL_?

Let's look into the core features of **GraphQL**, a query language and runtime designed by Facebook to enable efficient data communication between the client and server.

### Core Features

- **Declarative Data Fetching**: Empowers clients to request exactly what they need. With REST, developers often over-fetch or under-fetch data, causing inefficiencies in both data transmission and rendering. In contrast, GraphQL allows clients to specify their data requirements, leading to more efficient and specific data retrieval.

    - **Example**: Here is a structural query defined with GraphQL, automatically fetching necessary data.

    ```graphql
    query {
      user(id: "123") {
        name
        posts {
          title
          content
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Data is structured as a graph. GraphQL directives, which are used to annotate and modify existing schema types, can be coupled with the query language to impose rules on the query execution. For instance, `@include` and `@skip` enable conditional fetching of fields.

    - **Example**: The following query demonstrates conditional fetching using directives.

    ```graphql
    query {
      user(id: "123") {
        name
        posts {
          title
          content
          comments @include(if: $showComments)
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- **Strongly-Typed Schema**: Businesses and developers can benefit from type safety, reducing errors and unexpected behaviors. Every GraphQL API is formed from a set of well-defined object types with precise fields. This type system is backed by a schema that needs to be explicitly declared and shared.

  - **Example**: The schema-first approach uses SDL (Schema Definition Language) to define types and their relationships.

    ```graphql
    type User {
        id: ID!
        name: String!
        age: Int
    }
    ```

- **Single Endpoint for All Operations**: Simplifies the management and orchestration of data, as a single endpoint is utilized for all data interactions. This differs from REST-centric approaches, where endpoints are typically specific to resources or actions, leading to potential confusion in larger systems.

- **Built-in Documentation**: Provides auto-generated and readily-accessible documentation, easing the burden of maintaining external documentation. This "graphiql" in-browser environment, often utilized during the development stage, allows an interactive exploration of the available API and assists in writing precise queries.

- **Introspection**: Enables tools to query the GraphQL server itself for its schema. This meta-level functionality enhances the extensibility and productivity of developers by facilitating functionalities like dynamic query generation and language or platform-specific tooling.

- **Real-time Data**: Through **Subscriptions,** GraphQL offers a method for the server to actively push data to clients, creating remarkable opportunities for real-time interactions in modern apps. Whether it's chat applications or collaborative documents, this feature provides a seamless experience for end-users.

    - **Example**: A GraphQL query incorporating real-time data acquisition.

    ```graphql
    subscription {
      newUser {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    ```

### Benefits of Using GraphQL

- **Reduction in Over/Under Fetching**: Empowers clients to receive precisely the data they need, eradicating the efficiency challenges associated with over-fetching and under-fetching.

- **Improved Frontend Autonomy**: Fosters frontend independence, allowing teams to evolve their applications without necessitating corresponding backend alterations.

- **Enhanced Tooling and Efficiency**: The robust type system and schema enable advanced tooling and provide developers with comprehensive insights even at the time of query construction.

- **Adaptability and Evolvability**: Facilitates a more streamlined development lifecycle, particularly in contexts featuring rapid evolution or requirements for distinct client applications like web, mobile, and IoT.

## 5. What is a _GraphQL schema_ and why is it important?

**GraphQL Schema** serves as the contract between client and server, outlining available data types, their relationships, and the API surface.

### Core Schema Components

#### Object Types

Data in GraphQL is wrapped in object types. Each type comprises a set of fields, which can be other object types or scalar types.

Example:

The `User` type may comprise fields like `id` (a scalar) and `posts` (a list of the `Post` type).

#### Scalar Types

Scalar types are the atomic data types of GraphQL. They include standard types like `String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and `ID`. Custom scalar types allow for tailored behaviors, like `DateTime` for consistent date representation.

#### Query and Mutation Types

Both are **entry points** for the client:

- **Query**: Specifies available read operations clients can invoke.
- **Mutation**: Defines write operations.

Example:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!): User
}
```

#### Input Types

These represent data the client sends to the server during mutations. They are similar to object types but exclusively used as input.

Example:

```graphql
input UserInput {
  name: String!
}
```

#### Interfaces and Unions

These facilitate **complex type hierarchies**.

- **Interfaces**: A collection of shared fields which GraphQL types can implement.
- **Unions**: Acts as an "or" statement, allowing multiple types to be returned.

Example:

```graphql
interface Post {
  content: String!
  author: User!
}

type TextPost implements Post {
  content: String!
  author: User!
  wordCount: Int!
}

type ImagePost implements Post {
  content: String!
  author: User!
  imageUrl: String!
}

type Query {
  allPosts: [Post]!
}
```

#### Directives

These are like annotations and can modify the behavior of an operation. While they don't define data types, they are still part of the type system.

Example:

```graphql
directive @auth on FIELD_DEFINITION

type User {
  id: ID
  email: String! @auth
  password: String! @auth
}
```

#### Enumerations

These are custom object types that enumerate a defined set of options.

Example:

```graphql
enum UserRole {
  ADMIN
  USER
}
```

#### Multiple Types

A single GraphQL schema can **consist of various** types, including those mentioned above. Every field in the schema needs to resolve to one of the defined types.

### Why Are Schemas Important?

- **Clear Communication**: Schemas act as a clear API contract between the client and the server.
- **Structured Data**: They define data types and relationships, ensuring a structured data model.
- **Safety**: The schema helps in error detection and makes sure data types are consistently handled across the application.
- **Ease of Collaboration**: Schemas ensure that a front-end and back-end developer can work independently as long as they adhere to the schema contract.
- **Documentation Generation**: Schemas can be used to auto-generate developer-friendly documentation, promoting clarity and comprehension. 

### Schema Evolution

A GraphQL schema, like any software, is **subject to change and evolution**. However, changes need to be managed to ensure query compatibility. Visual tools, versioning strategies, and strong communication between teams are vital for seamless schema evolution.

#### Implementing Schemas and Types in Code

Below is the Node.js code:

1. **Define Schema and Types** with GraphQL

   ```javascript
   const { GraphQLObjectType, GraphQLSchema, GraphQLString, GraphQLList, GraphQLNonNull, GraphQLInterfaceType } = require('graphql');

   const UserType = new GraphQLObjectType({
      name: 'User',
      fields: () => ({
         id: { type: GraphQLString },
         name: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
         posts: {
            type: new GraphQLList(PostType),
            resolve: (user) => getUserPosts(user.id),
         },
      }),
   });
   
   const PostType = new GraphQLInterfaceType({
      name: 'Post',
      fields: () => ({
         content: { type: GraphQLString },
         author: { type: UserType },
      }),
      resolveType: (post) => {
         if (typeof post.wordCount !== 'undefined') {
            return 'TextPost';
         }
         return 'ImagePost';
      },
   });
   
   module.exports = new GraphQLSchema({
      types: [UserType, PostType],
      query: new GraphQLObjectType({
         name: 'RootQueryType',
         fields: {
            allPosts: {
               type: new GraphQLList(PostType),
               resolve: getAllPosts,
            },
         },
      }),
   });
   ```

2. **Specify Directives**

   ```javascript
   const { GraphQLDirective, DirectiveLocation, GraphQLString } = require('graphql');
   
   const authDirective = new GraphQLDirective({
      name: 'auth',
      description: 'Directive to control access to secure fields.',
      locations: [DirectiveLocation.FIELD_DEFINITION],
      args: {
         requires: { type: new GraphQLNonNull(GraphQLString) },
      },
      resolve: (next, src, args, context) => {
         // Implement your authentication logic
         return next();
      },
   });
   
   module.exports = new GraphQLSchema({
      directives: [authDirective],
      types: [UserType],
      query: new GraphQLObjectType({
         name: 'RootQueryType',
         fields: {
            user: {
               type: UserType,
               resolve: (root, args, context) => {
                  // Provide field values here
               },
               users: {
                  type: new GraphQLList(UserType),
                  auth: {
                     requires: 'admin',
                  },
                  resolve: (root, args, context) => {
                     // Provide field values here
                  },
               },
            },
         },
      }),
   });
   ```
<br>

## 6. Explain the concept of _fields_ in _GraphQL_.

**Fields** form the basis of GraphQL data retrieval. Whereas REST often necessitates multiple endpoints, GraphQL consolidates this need into a single **query**.

GraphQL representations are akin to objects, with each object possibly possessing numerous **fields**. This creates a hierarchy, especially useful when interacting with more complex datasets.

### Basic Structure

Queries consist of one or more fields. Each field can be an object, a scalar value, or an array of other objects or scalar values.

Structurally, a **field** within a query resembles an object property in JavaScript or a dictionary entry in Python.

### Self-Referring Objects

Fields can maintain a one-to-one mapping with backend resources. However, they can also **refer to themselves**. This self-reference is invaluable for processing hierarchical data structures.

A simple example is a tree, where each node can potentially have multiple child nodes.

GraphQL exploits self-referential fields to enable powerful data relationships, such as nodes having other nodes as their children. 

### Code Example: Simple Query

Here is the JSON representation:

```json

{
  "query": {
    "user": {
      "id": 123,
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }
}
```

And here is the corresponding algorithm:

```javascript
function fetchData(query) {
  const result = {};
  for (let field in query) {
    if (isValidField(field)) {
      result[field] = fetchData(query[field]);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

### Code Example: Self-Referring Queries

Here are the JSON representation and the corresponding Python algorithm:

```json

{
  "query": {
    "user": {
      "id": 123,
      "posts": {
        "title": "GraphQL Basics"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```python
def fetch_user_data(user_id, query):
    user_data = fetch_user_from_db(user_id)
    result = {}

    for field, value in user_data.items():
        if field in query:
            if isinstance(value, dict):
                result[field] = fetch_user_data(user_id, query[field])
            else:
                result[field] = value

    return result
```
<br>

## 7. How does _GraphQL_ handle _data types_?

**GraphQL** brings a robust **type system** that ensures clear data structures and reliable schema enforcement. Let's take a closer look at key concepts like **Scalars**, **Enums**, and **Input Types**.

### Types in GraphQL

- **Scalar**: Represents a single value, such as a string or number.
- **Object**: Defines a structured collection of fields, each with its type.
- **List**: Indicates an array of values of the specified type.
- **Enum**: Offers a predefined set of possible values.
- **Union**: Represents a selection of object types, yet only allows querying common fields.
- **Interface**: Guarantees certain fields on all possible implementing types.

### Code Example: Basic Scalar and Object Types

Here is Schema Definition Language (SDL):

- For a scalar type

```graphql
scalar DateTime
```

- For an object type

```graphql
type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  books: [Book]
}
```

And here is the complete schema with Query and Mutation:

```graphql
type Query {
  author(id: ID!): Author
  allAuthors: [Author]
}

type Mutation {
  addAuthor(name: String!): Author
}

type Book {
  title: String
  author: Author
}
```

### Code Example: Using Enums and Union Types

Here is schema using Enums:

```graphql
enum Episode {
  NEW_HOPE
  EMPIRE
  JEDI
}

type Character {
  name: String!
  appearsIn: [Episode!]!
}
```

And here is an example using Union Types:

```graphql
type Human {
  name: String!
  height(unit: LengthUnit = METER): Float
}

type Droid {
  id: String!
  name: String!
}

union SearchResult = Human | Droid
```

### Code Example: Custom Input Types

Here is a code example using **Scalars** and **Input Types**:

- For a scalar input:

```graphql
input DateRange {
  start: DateTime
  end: DateTime
}
```

- For a custom input type:

```graphql
type Query {
  getPosts(publishedAfter: DateRange): [Post]
}
```
<br>

## 8. In _GraphQL_, what are _queries_ and _mutations_?

In **GraphQL**, developers use two main types of operations to interact with data, known as **Queries** and **Mutations**.

### Queries

- **Purpose**: Read data from the server.
- **HTTP Equivalent**: Usually `GET`.
- **Immutability**: Queries are **Immutable**; they don't change server data.
- **Requesting Specific Fields**: Allows clients to fetch only the data they need, increasing efficiency.
- **Caching**: Results can be cached since queries remain consistent unless modified by the client.
- **Errors**: Fails if the server cannot fulfill the data request.

### Mutations

- **Purpose**: Modify data on the server.
- **HTTP Equivalent**: Typically `POST` or `PUT`.
- **Immutability**: Mutations are **Mutable**; they trigger data changes.
- **Requesting Specific Fields**: Can include a return payload of specific fields for client updates post-mutation.
- **Caching**: Results are typically not cacheable.
- **Errors**: Can indicate both successes and failures, and usually carry specific feedback.
<br>

## 9. Describe how you would fetch data with a _GraphQL query_.

When integrating **GraphQL**, data retrieval is performed through a query.

### Steps for Fetching Data with a GraphQL Query

1. **Define the Query**:
    GraphQL queries specify the exact shape and structure of the expected response using the same dataset as the server schema.

2. **Execute the Query**:
    Queries are typically triggered via an HTTP POST request to the server's endpoint.

3. **Handle the Response**:
    Expect the exact data structure that you requested, with no need for subsequent requests or data manipulation.	errors, and then receive the data in the precise shape you requested.

### Example GraphQL Query

```graphql
query {
  bookById(id: "4") {
    title
    author {
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```
<br>

## 10. What are _scalar types_ in _GraphQL_?

**GraphQL** augments traditional data modeling by incorporating its unique concept of **scalars**, which represent singular, atomic data types.

### Core Scalars

- **Int**: A signed 32-bit integer.
- **Float**: A double-precision floating-point number.
- **String**: A sequence of characters.

The **Boolean** type, representing true or false, is also one of the core scalars.

### Custom Scalars

Developers can define custom data types using **custom scalars** to match specific requirements. For instance, `Date` might be a developer-defined custom scalar that conforms to date-time values.

GraphQL provides easy extensibility through custom scalars to cater to diverse data types not covered by its core set or to enforce data consistency.

### Advantages

- **Uniformity**: Scalars ensure consistent data representation across diverse clients.
- **Ease of Extension**: Custom scalars let you unleash flexibility within GraphQL, tailoring data types to your unique needs.
- **Efficiency**: Since each query selects precisely what's needed, reduced data transmission decreases loading time and conserves bandwidth.
<br>

## 11. Explain the role of _resolvers_ in _GraphQL_.

**Resolvers** in GraphQL tie specific fields of a schema to the actual functions that resolve these fields. They are critical for data fetching and manipulation.

### Core Functions of Resolvers

- **Data Fetching**: The primary role of resolvers is to fetch the data for the fields they are responsible for.
- **Data Transformation**: Resolvers can perform any necessary transformations on the data before returning it to the client.
- **Data Source Specification**: Resolvers detail where to retrieve the data from (such as a database or an API).

### Resolver Structure

- **Single Responsibility**: A resolver is responsible for a specific field in the schema.
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Resolvers can "pass" data between related fields, e.g., a user resolver can return details about a user's posts.

### Resolver Types

- **Root Resolvers**: Deal with top-level query and mutation fields.
- **Nested Resolvers**: Handle specific fields on related types.

### Code Example: Resolvers in GraphQL

Here is the GraphQL Schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: Int!): User
}

type User {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post]
}

type Post {
  id: Int!
  title: String!
  content: String!
}
```

And here is the resolver code in JavaScript:

```javascript
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    user: (parent, { id }, context, info) => fetchUser(id),
  },
  User: {
    posts: (parent, args, context, info) => fetchPostsForUser(parent.id),
  },
};

// Sample data for illustration
const sampleData = {
  users: [
    { id: 1, name: "John" },
    { id: 2, name: "Jane" },
  ],
  posts: [
    { id: 1, title: "First Post", content: "Hello, first post!", userId: 1 },
  ],
};

function fetchUser(id) {
  return sampleData.users.find((user) => user.id === id);
}

function fetchPostsForUser(userId) {
  return sampleData.posts.filter((post) => post.userId === userId);
}
```

In this example, when a client sends a query for a user's posts, the `posts` resolver is invoked and calls `fetchPostsForUser` to retrieve the posts associated with that user.
<br>

## 12. What are the advantages of using _GraphQL_ over other API query languages?

**GraphQL** offers many advantages over traditional REST APIs, ranging from optimized client-server communication to improved developer experience.

### Advantages over REST

#### Efficient Data Retrieval

- **Selectivity**: GraphQL allows clients to specify the exact fields they need, reducing data over-fetching.
- **No Multiple Endpoints**: Instead of hitting multiple endpoints for diverse data, clients can make a single request.

#### Data Integrity

- **Strongly Typed Schema**: GraphQL ensures data consistency by defining a schema, a feature not inherent in REST.
- **Structured Endpoints**: REST APIs can alter data formats and required attributes, making assumptions about endpoint responses more error-prone.

#### Client-Specific Data Shaping

- **Client Needs Alignment**: GraphQL aligns server data with client requirements, promoting a more tailored approach for each client.

#### Reduced Chatter

- **Mitigated Under-Fetching**: REST can suffer from under-fetching, prompting multiple requests for comprehensive data.
- **Streamlined Data Collection**: GraphQL, on the other hand, accesses interconnected entities and their data with one consolidated request.

#### Real-Time Flexibility

- **Socket-Like Experience**: Integrated subscriptions in GraphQL allow for real-time updates, a feature often necessitating additional effort in REST.

### Advantages over Other Query Languages

#### Multiple Data Sources

- **Unified Backend**: With GraphQL, you can amalgamate data from various sources into a single endpoint, a setup that's more challenging with other languages like SQL.

#### Ecosystem Integration

- **Comprehensive API**: GraphQL has a robust toolset, including playgrounds that offer live interaction.
- **Inherent Documentation**: Its introspective nature ensures self-documenting APIs, a feature often less prominent in other query languages.

#### Post-Query Actions

- **Control Over Response**: Clients have unparalleled influence over the response format, something less straightforward in languages like SQL.
- **Data Manipulation**: With GraphQL, you can extrapolate data for specific tasks, going beyond the typical "get" operations.

#### Embedded Domain Solutions

- **Domain-Driven Applications**: GraphQL is effective in presenting the domain model to the user, enhancing user interaction and comprehension.

## 13. How do you pass _arguments_ to _fields_ in _GraphQL queries_?

In GraphQL, **queries** represent requests for specific data fields. To refine these requests, you can use **arguments** with fields. 

### Syntax for Passing Arguments

To **pass arguments**, include them within the parentheses next to the field name. Each argument is defined using its unique name followed by the colon `:` and the intended value.

#### Example: Retrieve a Specific User

```graphql
{
  user(id: "XYZ_123") {
    name
    email
  }
}
```

### Code Example: Passing Arguments

Here is the GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  booksByAuthor(author: String, count: Int): [Book]
}
```

And here is the query:

```graphql
{
  booksByAuthor(author: "JK Rowling", count: 3) {
    title
  }
}
```

## 14. What is a _fragment_ in _GraphQL_ and how are they used?

In **GraphQL**, a **fragment** enables describing a set of fields that can be repeatedly used across multiple queries.

### Benefits of Fragments

- **Reusability**: Easily reuse identical fields in various queries.
- **Modularity**: Enhance code organization by separating logical groupings.
- **Clarity**: Increase readability by outlining expected data needs in one place.

### Fragment Definition and Reference

#### Definition

Fragments are crafted using the `fragment` keyword and must specify a **name** along with the desired fields. They are scoped to a particular type.

```graphql
fragment UserInfo on User {
  id
  name
  email
}
```

#### Reference

To incorporate a fragment into a query, you utilize the `...` (spread) syntax followed by the fragment name.

```graphql
query GetUserAndTheirPost {
  user(id: "123") {
    ...UserInfo
  }
  postsForUser(id: "123") {
    ...PostInfo
  }
}
```

### Handling Duplicates

While fragments help with code modularity and repeated field lists, GraphQL servers are smart enough to **deduplicate** and combine fields from all sources, ensuring minimal overhead in the underlying data fetch.

### Multiple Fragments

Queries can reference multiple fragments, and the fields from all fragments get composed in the query, streamlining data handling.

```graphql
query GetMyData {
  myself {
    ...BasicUserInfo
    ...ExtendedUserInfo
    ...UserAddressInfo
  }
}
```

### Client-Specific Fragments

Sometimes, clients might have unique field requirements that the server's general schema doesn't cover. For this, client-specific fragments offer an avenue to define custom fields tailored to the client's needs.

```graphql
fragment DisplayUserInfo on User {
  ... on RegularUser {
    subscriptionStatus
    lastLogin
    securityQuestions
  }
  ... on AdminUser {
    permissions
    staffSince
  }
}
```

In contrast to globally defined fragments, client-specific fragments cater to the specific needs of the query or operation where they're referenced.

## 15. How does _GraphQL_ handle _caching_?

**Data Federation** in GraphQL, achieved through resolvers, instigates caching at multiple levels to heighten efficiency and optimize data handling.

### Caching Strategies

#### Level 1: Client-Side Caching

- **Purpose**: Minimize network traffic and local state management.
- **Mechanism**: `Apollo Client` offers automatic in-memory caching. This ensures that redundant requests such as querying the same data multiple times don't hit the server.

#### Level 2: Cloud-Controlled Caching

- **Purpose**: Amplify efficiency by using explicitly stated HTTP caching directives.
- **Mechanism**: The caching mechanism of the server is dependent on the HTTP cache-control headers. If data is cacheable, these headers specify how long it should be kept in the cache.

#### Level 3: Persistent Caching

- **Purpose**: Establish a global and persistent cache for recurrent data requests.
- **Mechanism**: Beyond the scope of GraphQL per se, several solutions like Redis for in-memory caching or Apache Ignite as a distributed cache facilitate data storage, minimizing the need for repeated remote calls.

### Multi-Level Cache Coherency

GraphQL employs strategies to ensure coherence across the various cache levels:

- **Real-Time Feed**: With subscriptions, a server can alert the client about new data, prompting cache updates.
- **Partial Updates**: Through `GraphQL` subscriptions, you can tailor the response to only include changed or updated information, preventing a full cache refresh.
- **Optimistic UI and cache updates**: `Apollo Client` manages client-side cache updates, providing immediate UI feedback. Updates are subsequently synched with the server, ensuring coherence.

### Code Example: Caching Directives

Here is the `GraphQL SDL` schema definitions:

```graphql
type Query {
  # Utilizes defaults from server config
  getUser(id: ID!): User @cacheControl

  # A specific request with an assigned cache time
  getPost(id: ID!): Post @cacheControl(maxAge: 60)

  # Bypasses cache directives
  getMessage(id: ID!): Message @cacheControl(maxAge: 0)
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  content: String!
}

type Message {
  id: ID!
  text: String!
}

directive @cacheControl(
  maxAge: Int
  scope: CacheScope
  inheritMaxAge: Boolean
) on FIELD_DEFINITION | OBJECT | INTERFACE
```
